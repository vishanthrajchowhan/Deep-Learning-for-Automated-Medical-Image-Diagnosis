Designed and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and OpenCV to detect anomalies in medical imaging with 95% accuracy, reducing manual screening efforts.

Deployed the model via a Flask API to enable real-time inference and seamless integration with external health information systems.
